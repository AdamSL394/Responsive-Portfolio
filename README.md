# Responsive-Portfolio

This Repo shows the ability to change screen size using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp">Media Queries </a> 
We are able to set the Maximum or Minimum width we want our screen to adjust at. We can set specific alignment, padding, margin & much more at thess widths only & not effect the rest of our code. Media Queries allow the layouts and information to adjust from Desktop to laptop, tablet or phone. 

## Prequisites
You need to git pull this repo to your desktop using git clone . and the url from git hub.  

## Running Tests
Open the file in  your browser (preferably google chrome) to test the code.
This will show how the computer reads the code and presents the information correctly placed and positioned using padding and margin. Adjust the window size to see the content shift as the screen sizes reaches different sizes.
